Re: random subsystem in Racket.  Want to use (random-seed (current-milliseconds)) to get started.
For recreating same number stream in a new score, save (current-milliseconds) via number->string
to seed field in score.  There's better ways in Racket to initialize the pseudo-random number
generator but I'm not sure they're worth the effort of recording a vector in the seed.

Remember also progression by increasing intensity, e.g. for period use series like fibonacci, 
e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, so the rate of change accelerates.
