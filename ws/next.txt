Using morph-motifs:

done:

- 1) code routine but not as generator
- 2) create simple unit test that just successively transposes
- 3) add pan as dynamic control with midi tag

to do:

- 1) integrate minimally into ws/sketch-workspace.rkt


- ideas

- choir of fast voices all on same motif, experiment with dynamic pan, for chaining
  use matrix mod like for bittersweet transpositions
  * add pan as control
    - verify dynamic pan works by hacking control into existing .ly file (done)
    - expand rendering of controls to flag some with midi tag, e.g. pan, dynamic range, etc.
    - manipulate choir as a whole e.g. 4/8 voices all same instrument
      * start with all mid-channel, brief splits by half/quarter/eighth, back and forth
      * then chain L->R transition in sequence starting all center or distributed
      * sequence continuously around L->R/L->R ... for swirl or L->R/R->L ... for bounce

  * rotate in and out from unison, combined with scale mods, flats below, sharps above etc.
    scale mods make more sense combined with rotation, though maybe reverting back from
    rotation to unison could continue with different scale

  * incremental synchronicity mods like piano phase, starting with one or more voices forward,
    others backward, one-by-one, sequentially or in chorus
